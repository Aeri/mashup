## The mashups

By **Friday** have the following done (~1 hour)

* **Views. (Minimum of three)** Take an index card and draw a page (a "view") of your application. For example, Twitter's views we went over in class were the "login" and the "timeline" view.
* **Models.** Name each of the models and what their attributes are. For example: **User** model, with an ID, Name, Gender, Age, Allergies.
* **System diagram.** Draw one like the one we did in class: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1j8zTw2WCQNX2zceda3d3_uU2d7Ug35gJzVFI03sPUfs/edit?usp=sharing Name your views and models explicitly when you're doing this.
